For this milestone we implemented the following changes:

- UI improvements: using graphics instead of text.
- Created island that players race on. Added animated water, points of interest. 
- Created pickups that improve the players car.
- Created a ready up scene/tutorial. Improved main menu.
- Created building area and added other improvements to arena.
- Created 'score zones' which is where players race to to win the game (we figured out the "point" of our game).
- Created a full game loop with a building phase and point counters (instead of a simple, boring, timer).
- We spent time improving the damage giving and receiving logic, but still have work to do before shipping that system to production.
